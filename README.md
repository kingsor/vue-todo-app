# vue-todo-app

> A Vue.js project

Simple Todo app created following this tutorial: [Build a To-Do App with Vue.js 2](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2) on [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/)

Nice tutorial easy to follow, some missing step but diving in the [github project](https://github.com/scotch-io/vue-todo) I was able to complete it getting a working sample.



## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
